Â¿How to do game logic?
i need hand to know its rank by type and value
-> object
-> call it twice: 
    switch highest requirement to return value
    swicth highest requirement to print

poker_game:
    [a,b] = process input
    type_a = highest_requirement_fulfilled()
    "
    rank_a = rank...()
    "
    #rank_a depends on rank_b, so not static
    #but type should be an object characteristic
    if type_a<type_b:
        print("White wins. - with:")
