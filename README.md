# Kata repository

Hello! 

This repository is for katas (or short exercises) I do in programming.

## How to run the tests

### Javascript katas

On a kata folder use `npm install` to install the dependencies of the project.
Then, use `npm test` to run the tests, or `npm run watch` to run mocha in "watch mode" to automatically re-run tests whenever
the source files change.

Prerequisites:

* NodeJS

### Go katas

On a kata folder use `go test` to run the test file, this will also install the dependencies of the project if you don't have them yet.

Prerequisites:

* Go
